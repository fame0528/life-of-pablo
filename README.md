# Life of Pablo ‚Äì Real-Time Multiplayer Simulation Game

Welcome to **Life of Pablo**, a real-time multiplayer browser-based simulation game where players start broke in a gritty urban environment and must climb their way up through cultivation, manufacturing, trading, and criminal enterprise. This project aims to deliver a deep, feature-rich, and highly interactive experience inspired by cyberpunk and urban underworld themes.

## üéÆ Game Vision & Overview

- **Start from nothing:** Players begin with $500, an empty inventory, and no access to advanced features.
- **Progress through realistic systems:** Cultivate, manufacture, and trade goods; own properties, vehicles, and labs; travel globally; join gangs; engage in PVP combat and alliances.
- **Persistent, real-time world:** All actions and economies are synced in real time, with offline progress and dynamic events.
- **No vague features:** Every system is fully defined, with no placeholders or missing information.

## üìÅ File & Component Structure

```
/src/
  /components/   # All UI components (see LOP.md for full list)
  /contexts/     # React context providers (GameState, Auth, Gang, Admin)
  /hooks/        # Custom React hooks (useGameLogic, useSocket, etc.)
  /services/     # API, socket, and data services
  /utils/        # Utility functions (price calc, event gen, etc.)
  /pages/        # Page-level components (Overview, City Map, etc.)
  /data/         # (Deprecated: all data now in Supabase)
  /stories/      # Storybook stories for components
  /assets/       # Images, icons, sounds
  index.html
  main.tsx
  App.tsx
  ...
```

All components are modular, focused, and reusable. Use React hooks and context for state management. Avoid global variables and side effects.
